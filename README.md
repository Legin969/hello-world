# hello-world

It's been 30 years since I last programmed anythhing heavy duty. I first learned Cobol and Assembler at university. I designed and developed business games and simulations on an Apple II. In the mid-90's I became familiar with C running on Unix. Fifteen years ago I learned HTML and CSS for designing websites.
